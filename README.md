## MyCreds
A project for creating verifiable credentials of educational records for ARUCC-Canada

## About this project
The project enables a secure digital wallet (i.e. MyCreds) where graduates can view and share their official, verified educational credentials anytime, and from anywhere. 
There are various government bodies, partners and stakeholders are involved in brining this idea to life and making the MyCreds an innovative platform to deliver value in the Canadian educational sector. 

#### ARUCC: 
ARUCC (Association of Registrars of the Universities and Colleges of Canada) which is a national body of registrars and enrollments services professionals of recognized colleges and universities. The association is the owner of the MyCreds, a platform which offers a document exchange and credential wallet for students and graduates. This initiative is being collaboration i

#### MATTR: 
MATTR is a market leader in providing a platform for offering digital identities and verifiable credentials. MATTR has taken digital trust and interactions over the internet to the next level, contributed in the standards community and shaping up the future of the digital identity space.   

#### Digitary:
Digitary provides solution in educational sector to issue and verify the digital credentials for the educational degree certificates, transcripts and other sensitive documents online.

### Standards and Specifications 
In this project, there are various standards and specifications which are being used to establish the integrity of the educational credentials.  

- #### Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0: 
A globally unique persistent identifier that does not require a centralized registration authority and is often generated and/or registered cryptographically. Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A DID refers to any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.)

For more details about the DID specifications, visit [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/REC-did-core-20220719/). Also you can watch some videos on the same topic at MATTR YouTube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWgAgpfLEIQ&list=PL1v34OMpKjALowB6oxDYmCvoYfWeiUe_4&index=5)


A sample DID document is presented below for reference.

```
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
    "https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"
  ]
  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
  "authentication": [{
    
    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
    "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",
    "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
    "publicKeyMultibase": "zH3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
  }]
}
```

- #### Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1.1: 

[Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) are a W3C standard data model for expressing cryptographically secure digital credentials on the web.

Though they are both part of the VC data model, [Verifiable Credentials - VCs](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#credentials) are distinct from [Verifiable Presentations - VPs](w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations). Presentations are typically generated or derived from VCs and presented by credential holders for the purposes of verification.

The VC data model defines two concrete data syntaxes, JSON and JSON-LD. JSON-LD allows the VC data model to be extensible and interoperable while remaining distributed in its architecture.

When combined with DIDs, VCs provide a decentralized data sharing model where interconnected webs of signed and linked data can be used to establish trust across contexts.

To learn more about the VCs data model, refer to the details on W3C [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/). Watch a few videos on this topic published by MATTR [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H099_hTRc4&list=PL1v34OMpKjALowB6oxDYmCvoYfWeiUe_4&index=6). 

- #### JSON-LD:
JSON-LD is a JSON-based format used to serialize Linked Data. Linked Data plays a very important role when it comes to exchanging verifiable information. JSON-LD is designed to facilitate sharing and discovering data in web-based environments. There are several available guides online that describe JSON-LD in detail. Weâ€™re going to focus on two required properties of JSON-LD that consistently show up in the VC data model, namely @context and type. 

For more details, refer to the specification of [JSON-LD](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/). 

### International organisations supporting digital identities and verifiable credentials  

- #### W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community that develops open standards to ensure the long-term growth of the Web. W3C's primary activity is to develop protocols and guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the Web. W3C's standards define key parts of what makes the World Wide Web work
