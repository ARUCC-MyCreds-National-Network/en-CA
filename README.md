## MyCreds
A project for creating verifieable credentials of educational records for ARUCC-Canada

## About this project
The project enables a secure digital wallet (i.e. MyCreds) where graduates can view and share their official, veirified educational credentials anytime, and from anywhere. 
There are various government bodies, partners and stakeholders are involved in brining this idea to life and making the MyCreds an innovative platform to deliver value in the Canadian educational sector. 

#### ARUCC: 
ARUCC (Association of Registrars of the Universities and Colleges of Canada) which is a national body of registrers adn enrollments services professionals of recognized colleges and universities. The association is the owner of the MyCreds, a platfrom which offers a document exchange and credential wallet for students and graduates. This initiaitve is being collaboration i

#### MATTR: 
MATTR is a market leader in providing a platform for offering digital identities and verifieable credentials. MATTR has taken digital trust and interactions over the internet to the next level, contributed in the standards community and shaping up the future of the digital identity space.   

#### Digitary:
Digitary provides solution in educational sector to issue and varify the digital credentials for the educational degree certificates, transcripts and other senetitive documents online. 


### Standards and Specifications 
In this project, there are various standards and specifications are being used to establish the integrity of the educational credentials.  

#### Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0: 
A globally unique persistent identifier that does not require a centralized registration authority and is often generated and/or registered cryptographically. Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A DID refers to any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.)

#### Verifieable Credentials Data Model v1.1: 

[Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) are a W3C standard data model for expressing cryptographically secure digital credentials on the web.

Though they are both part of the VC data model, [Verifiable Credentials - VCs](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#credentials) are distinct from [Verifiable Presentations - VPs](w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations). Presentations are typically generated or derived from VCs and presented by credential holders for the purposes of verification.

The VC data model defines two concrete data syntaxes, JSON and JSON-LD. JSON-LD allows the VC data model to be extensible and interoperable while remaining distributed in its architecture.

When combined with DIDs, VCs provide a decentralized data sharing model where interconnected webs of signed and linked data can be used to establish trust across contexts.

To learn more about the VCs data model, refer to the details on W3C [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/).
