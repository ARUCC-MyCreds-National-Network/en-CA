## MyCreds<sup>TM</sup>
MyCreds<sup>TM</sup> | MesCertif<sup>TM</sup> Virtual Skills Passport Pilot Project for micro-credentials - A project creating verifiable credentials for the educational records of Canadian post-secondary institutions.

## About this project
MyCreds<sup>TM</sup> provides learners and graduates access to a secure digital wallet where they can view and share their official, verified educational credentials on a 24/7 basis – anytime, anywhere. 

This pilot project is extending the MyCreds<sup>TM</sup> network capabilities by leveraging innovative technology and digitization principles to deliver self-sovereign identity (SSI) and verifiable credentials.

To bring this idea to life, various partners and stakeholders are involved in developing an innovative platform to transform the future of academic credentials.  

#### ARUCC: 
The Association of Registrars of the Universities and Colleges of Canada (ARUCC) is a national body of registrars and enrollment services professionals of recognized colleges and universities. The association is the owner of MyCreds<sup>TM</sup> | MesCertif<sup>TM</sup>, a platform that offers an official document exchange network and digital credential wallets for students and graduates.

#### MATTR:
MATTR is a market leader in providing a platform for offering digital identities and verifiable credentials. MATTR has taken digital trust and interactions over the internet to the next level, contributed to the standards community and shaped the future of the digital identity space.

For this project, the MATTR platform is enabled to support Digitary in shaping up the credential generation, verification, and revocation capabilities.

#### Digitary:
Digitary provides solutions in the educational sector to issue and verify the digital credentials for educational degree certificates, transcripts and other sensitive documents online. 

For this project, Digitary, in collaboration with MATTR and ARUCC, is enabling the complete value chain of digital credentials. The Digitary CORE technology powers the ARUCC MyCreds<sup>TM</sup> National Network.

## Standards and Specifications 
In this project, there are various standards and specifications are being used to establish the integrity of the educational credentials. Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0: 
A globally unique persistent identifier that does not require a centralized registration authority and is often generated and/or registered cryptographically. Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A DID refers to any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.)

Following are the key benefits associated with DIDs. 

-   DIDs are globally unique, highly available and cryptographically verifiable 
-   A user can prove the ownership of one Preserves the user's privacy, transparency and trust
-   Improve audit trails to support compliance

- #### Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1.1: 

[Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) are a W3C standard data model for expressing cryptographically secure digital credentials on the web.

Though they are both part of the VC data model, [Verifiable Credentials - VCs](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#credentials) are distinct from [Verifiable Presentations - VPs](w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations). Presentations are typically generated or derived from VCs and presented by credential holders for verification.

The VC data model defines two concrete data syntaxes, JSON and JSON-LD. JSON-LD allows the VC data model to be extensible and interoperable while remaining distributed in its architecture.

Here are a few advantages of having verifiable credentials. 

- Defined by a common standard (W3C) that enhances interoperability  
- Cryptographically secured using digital signatures 
- Provides control over the information sharing  
- Multiple credentials in a single presentation 

To learn more about the VCs data model, refer to the details on W3C [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/). Watch a few videos on this topic published by MATTR [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H099_hTRc4&list=PL1v34OMpKjALowB6oxDYmCvoYfWeiUe_4&index=6).

### ARUCC Interop Profile
An interop profile, short for interoperability profile, is a specification that defines the technical requirements and standards that must be followed to issue, verify, and use verifiable credentials across different systems and platforms.

Interop profiles are important for ensuring that verifiable credentials can be exchanged and verified seamlessly between different organizations, platforms, and systems. By following a common set of technical requirements and standards, organizations can ensure that their verifiable credentials are compatible with other systems and can be trusted by all parties.

Interop profiles help to ensure that verifiable credentials can be trusted and used by different parties, which is critical for the widespread adoption of this technology. By following a common set of technical requirements and standards, organizations can benefit from the interoperability and portability of verifiable credentials, while also maintaining the security and privacy of the underlying data.

For ARUCC, we have published an interop profile that refers to as a specification document and covers the patterns and examples used for the Verifiable Credential issuance and verification of the educational records requested by a post-secondary institution in Canada. These credentials are issued based on the JSON-LD format as defined by W3C. 

For more information, please refer to the specification for the [ARUCC Interop Profile](https://academic-microcredential-vocab.mattrlabs.com/) and the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ARUCC-MyCreds-National-Network/academic-microcredential-vocab). 

### ARUCC Industry Partner (Verifier) setup

Before a verifier, or industry partner, can use MyCreds<sup>TM</sup> to verify a learner's credential, they need to be set up with certain prerequisites. These prerequisites are outlined below:

Here are some of the prerequisites required to set up a verifier before credential information is verified. 

1. __Tenant Setup__: A new tenant is created with the necessary information that can be initiated with the MATTR. For more information, see the [Tenant Setup](https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/essentials/tenant-setup).

It is assumed that each verifier will utilize a DID:Web to represent themselves. This should be setup by following the MATTR learn tutorial [Create Web DID](https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/dids/did-web).

2. __Configure Custom Domain__: A custom domain represents your brand and reflects trust for the end-users. To create a custom domain for your organization, please follow the tutorial on creating a [Custom Domain](https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/essentials/custom-domain). 

3. __Presentation Request Template__: The presentation template is required to determine the credential type and the claims being requested by a verifier for the credential holder i.e. Learner. To create a presentation template, please follow the MATTR learn tutorial on creating the [Presentation Template](https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/web-credentials/verify/presentation-template/overview).

4. __Verifier Setup__: There are two approaches available for the Verifiers in the ARUCC ecosystem, depending on the integration pattern being used: 

__####Verify with call-back__: The response to each presentation request is returned to the MATTR VII platform where the credential is verified. Once verified and determined to be valid, MATTR VII will return the claims from the credential as a JSON payload to the specified call-back URL.  
To use this approach, please follow the tutorial on verifying a credential using a [callback](https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/web-credentials/verify/callback/overview), which explains the steps and configuration required. 


__####Verify via OIDC Bridge__: Utilizes an OAuth2/OIDC authorization request pattern to initiate the presentation request while establishing the identity of the holder as part of the flow. 
Using the presentation template configured in “step 3” above, the Verify a Credential using OIDC Bridge tutorial explains the steps and configuration required. For more details, please follow the MATTR learn tutorial [Verify a Credential using OIDC Bridge](https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/web-credentials/verify/oidc-bridge/overview).
