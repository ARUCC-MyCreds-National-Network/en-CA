## MyCreds
MyCreds<sup>TM</sup> | MesCertif<sup>TM</sup> Virtual Skills Passport Pilot Project for micro-credentials - A project creating verifiable credentials for the educational records of Canadian post-secondary institutions.

## About this project
MyCreds<sup>TM</sup> provides learners and graduates access to a secure digital wallet where they can view and share their official, verified educational credentials on a 24/7 basis â€“ anytime, anywhere. 

This pilot project is extending the MyCreds<sup>TM</sup> network capabilities by leveraging innovative technology and digitisation principles to deliver self-sovereign identity (SSI) and verifiable credentials.

To bring this idea to life, various partners and stakeholders are involved in developing an innovative platform to transform the future of academic credentials.  


#### ARUCC: 
The Association of Registrars of the Universities and Colleges of Canada (ARUCC) is a national body of registrars and enrollment services professionals of recognized colleges and universities. The association is the owner of MyCreds<sup>TM</sup> | MesCertif<sup>TM</sup>, a platform that offers an official document exchange network and digital credential wallets for students and graduates.

#### MATTR:
MATTR is a market leader in providing a platform for offering digital identities and verifiable credentials. MATTR has taken digital trust and interactions over the internet to the next level, contributed to the standards community and shaped the future of the digital identity space.

For this project, the MATTR platform is enabled to support Digitary in shaping up the credential generation, verification, and revocation capabilities.

#### Digitary:
Digitary provides solutions in the educational sector to issue and verify the digital credentials for educational degree certificates, transcripts and other sensitive documents online. 

For this project, Digitary, in collaboration with MATTR and ARUCC, is enabling the complete value chain of digital credentials. The Digitary CORE technology powers the ARUCC MyCreds<sup>TM</sup> National Network.

## Standards and Specifications 
In this project, there are various standards and specifications which are being used to establish the integrity of the educational credentials.  



- #### Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0: 
A globally unique persistent identifier that does not require a centralized registration authority and is often generated and/or registered cryptographically. Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A DID refer to any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.)

Following are the key benefits associated with DIDs. 

-   DIDs are globally unique, highly available and cryptographically verifiable 
-   A user can prove the ownership of one 
-   Preserves the user privacy, transparency and trust
-   Improve audit trails to support compliance   

For more details about the DID specifications, visit [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/REC-did-core-20220719/). Also, you can watch some videos on the same topic on the MATTR YouTube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWgAgpfLEIQ&list=PL1v34OMpKjALowB6oxDYmCvoYfWeiUe_4&index=5)


- #### Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1.1: 

[Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) are a W3C standard data model for expressing cryptographically secure digital credentials on the web.

Though they are both part of the VC data model, [Verifiable Credentials - VCs](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#credentials) are distinct from [Verifiable Presentations - VPs](w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations). Presentations are typically generated or derived from VCs and presented by credential holders for verification.

The VC data model defines two concrete data syntaxes, JSON and JSON-LD. JSON-LD allows the VC data model to be extensible and interoperable while remaining distributed in its architecture.

Here are the few advantages of having verifiable credentials. 

- Defined by a common standard (W3C) that enhances interoperability  
- Cryptographically secured using digital signatures 
- Provides control over the information sharing  
- Multiple credentials in a single presentation 

To learn more about the VCs data model, refer to the details on W3C [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/). Watch a few videos on this topic published by the MATTR [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H099_hTRc4&list=PL1v34OMpKjALowB6oxDYmCvoYfWeiUe_4&index=6).
